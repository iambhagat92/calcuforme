            <h2>Understanding Self-Employment Tax</h2>
            <p>Self-employment tax is a federal tax that consists of Social Security and Medicare taxes for individuals who work for themselves. Unlike traditional employees who split these taxes with their employer, self-employed individuals must pay the full amount themselves.</p>
            
            <h3>Current Self-Employment Tax Rates (2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Security Tax:</strong> 12.4% on income up to $168,600</li>
                <li><strong>Medicare Tax:</strong> 2.9% on all income</li>
                <li><strong>Additional Medicare Tax:</strong> 0.9% on income over $200,000 (single) or $250,000 (married filing jointly)</li>
                <li><strong>Total Rate:</strong> 15.3% for most self-employed individuals</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Who Must Pay Self-Employment Tax?</h3>
            <p>You must pay self-employment tax if you had net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Freelancers and independent contractors</li>
                <li>Business owners (sole proprietors, partners in partnerships)</li>
                <li>Gig economy workers (Uber, Lyft, DoorDash drivers)</li>
                <li>Consultants and professional service providers</li>
                <li>Online sellers and e-commerce entrepreneurs</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>How to Calculate Self-Employment Tax</h3>
            <p>The calculation involves several steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Calculate Net Self-Employment Income:</strong> Total income minus business expenses</li>
                <li><strong>Apply the 92.35% Factor:</strong> Multiply by 0.9235 to account for the employer-equivalent portion</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate Social Security Tax:</strong> Apply 12.4% to income up to the wage base limit</li>
                <li><strong>Calculate Medicare Tax:</strong> Apply 2.9% to all adjusted income</li>
                <li><strong>Add Additional Medicare Tax:</strong> 0.9% on income exceeding thresholds</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Self-Employment Tax Deductions</h3>
            <p>The good news is that you can deduct the employer-equivalent portion (50%) of your self-employment tax when calculating your adjusted gross income. This effectively reduces your overall tax burden.</p>

            <h3>Quarterly Estimated Tax Payments</h3>
            <p>Since no employer withholds taxes from your self-employment income, you're responsible for making quarterly estimated tax payments to avoid penalties. These payments should include both income tax and self-employment tax.</p>

            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Important Reminder</h4>
                <p>Self-employment tax is separate from income tax. Even if you don't owe income tax, you may still owe self-employment tax if your net self-employment earnings are $400 or more.</p>
