# 🚀 Deploy Calculate For Me to Vercel

## ✅ Quick Deployment Steps

Since the Vercel CLI has network issues, use the **web-based deployment** method:

### **Method 1: GitHub → Vercel (Recommended)**

1. **Create GitHub Repository**
   ```bash
   # Initialize git (if not already done)
   git init
   
   # Add all files
   git add .
   
   # Commit
   git commit -m "Calculate For Me - Complete Project Ready for Deployment"
   
   # Create repo on GitHub and push
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/Calculate For Me.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to: https://vercel.com/new
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your GitHub repository
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Done! Your site will be live in 2 minutes

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Issue:** Vercel CLI not working
- **Solution:** Use web-based deployment (methods above)

**Issue:** Build fails
- **Solution:** This is a static site, no build needed
- Set Build Command to empty

**Issue:** 404 errors
- **Solution:** vercel.json handles routing automatically

**Issue:** Assets not loading
- **Solution:** Check relative paths in HTML files
- All paths use `../` which works correctly
