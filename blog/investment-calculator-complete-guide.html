        <div class="calculator-embed">
            <h3>🧮 Try Our Investment Calculator</h3>
            <p>Calculate your investment returns instantly with our advanced investment calculator.</p>
            <a href="../calculators/investment-calculator.html" class="btn">Use Investment Calculator</a>
        </div>

        <h2>What is an Investment Calculator?</h2>
        
        <p>An investment calculator is a digital tool that helps you estimate the future value of your investments based on various parameters like initial investment, regular contributions, expected returns, and time period. These calculators use mathematical formulas to project how your money will grow through compound interest and regular investing.</p>

        <h3>Key Features of Investment Calculators:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Future Value Projections:</strong> Estimate how much your investment will be worth in the future</li>
            <li><strong>SIP Calculations:</strong> Calculate systematic investment plan returns</li>
            <li><strong>Lump Sum Analysis:</strong> Analyze one-time investment growth</li>
            <li><strong>Goal-Based Planning:</strong> Determine how much to invest for specific financial goals</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison Tools:</strong> Compare different investment scenarios</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Types of Investment Calculations</h2>

        <h3>1. Future Value Calculation</h3>
        <p>The future value calculation helps you understand how much your current investment will be worth at a future date.</p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>Future Value Formula:</strong><br>
            FV = PV × (1 + r)^n<br><br>
            Where:<br>
            FV = Future Value<br>
            PV = Present Value (Initial Investment)<br>
            r = Annual Interest Rate<br>
            n = Number of Years
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Example:</h4>
            <p>If you invest ₹1,00,000 at 12% annual return for 10 years:</p>
            <p>FV = 1,00,000 × (1 + 0.12)^10 = ₹3,10,585</p>
            <p>Your investment will grow to approximately ₹3.1 lakhs in 10 years.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) Calculation</h3>
        <p>SIP calculations help you determine the future value of regular monthly investments.</p>

        <div class="formula-box">
            <strong>SIP Future Value Formula:</strong><br>
            FV = PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] × (1 + r)<br><br>
            Where:<br>
            PMT = Monthly Investment Amount<br>
            r = Monthly Return Rate (Annual Rate/12)<br>
            n = Number of Months
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>SIP Example:</h4>
            <p>Monthly SIP: ₹5,000 | Annual Return: 12% | Period: 15 years</p>
            <p>Monthly Rate: 12%/12 = 1% or 0.01</p>
            <p>Number of Months: 15 × 12 = 180</p>
            <p>Future Value = ₹5,000 × [((1.01)^180 - 1) / 0.01] × 1.01 = ₹25,04,458</p>
            <p><strong>Total Investment:</strong> ₹9,00,000 | <strong>Returns:</strong> ₹16,04,458</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Advanced Investment Calculations</h2>

        <h3>1. Retirement Planning Calculation</h3>
        <p>To calculate how much you need to save for retirement:</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Retirement Planning Example:</h4>
            <p><strong>Current Age:</strong> 30 years | <strong>Retirement Age:</strong> 60 years</p>
            <p><strong>Current Monthly Expenses:</strong> ₹50,000 | <strong>Inflation:</strong> 6% annually</p>
            <p><strong>Expected Return:</strong> 12% annually</p>
            
            <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Calculate future monthly expenses</p>
            <p>Future Expenses = 50,000 × (1.06)^30 = ₹2,87,175 per month</p>
            
            <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Calculate retirement corpus needed</p>
            <p>Corpus = Monthly Expenses × 12 × 25 = ₹2,87,175 × 300 = ₹8.6 Crores</p>
            
            <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Calculate monthly SIP needed</p>
            <p>Monthly SIP = ₹8.6 Crores ÷ SIP Factor = ₹14,500 approximately</p>
        </div>

        <h3>2. Education Fund Planning</h3>
        <p>Planning for your child's education requires careful calculation of future costs.</p>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Education Planning Example:</h4>

            <p><strong>Education Age:</strong> 18 years | <strong>Education Inflation:</strong> 8% annually</p>
            
            <p><strong>Future Education Cost:</strong></p>
            <p>₹10,00,000 × (1.08)^13 = ₹27,19,317</p>
            
            <p><strong>Monthly SIP Required (12% return):</strong></p>
            <p>Monthly SIP = ₹27,19,317 ÷ 285.94 = ₹9,508</p>

        <h2>Investment Calculator FAQs</h2>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Q1: What is an investment calculator and how does it work?</h4>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> An investment calculator is a financial tool that helps you estimate the future value of your investments based on initial amount, regular contributions, expected returns, and time period. It uses compound interest formulas to show how your money can grow over time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Q2: How do I calculate SIP returns?</h4>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> SIP returns are calculated using the formula: FV = PMT × [((1 + r)^n - 1) / r] × (1 + r), where PMT is monthly investment, r is monthly return rate, and n is number of months. This accounts for compound growth of regular investments.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="example-box">
            <h4>Q3: What's the difference between lump sum and SIP investments?</h4>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Lump sum involves investing a large amount at once, while SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) involves regular smaller investments over time. SIP offers rupee cost averaging benefits and reduces timing risk, while lump sum can benefit from immediate market exposure.</p>
