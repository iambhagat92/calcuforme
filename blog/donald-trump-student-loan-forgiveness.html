          <h2>Quick Answer</h2>
          <p>During the 2017–2021 period, there was no broad, one-time student loan cancellation enacted under Donald Trump. However, in 2020 the federal government paused payments and set interest to 0% during the COVID-19 emergency—this was significant relief, but not legal “forgiveness” because balances were not canceled. Targeted discharges (like borrower defense) remained available under stricter rules at the time. Going forward, large-scale blanket forgiveness is generally less likely under a Republican platform, while policy ideas often emphasize school accountability, limiting certain lending, and recalibrating repayment plan rules. Actual changes depend on Congress, regulatory processes, and courts.</p>

        <section id="what-counts-as-forgiveness">
          <h2>What Counts as Student Loan “Forgiveness”</h2>
          <p><strong>Forgiveness or discharge</strong> means some or all of your federal student debt is permanently canceled under specific rules. This is different from a temporary <em>payment pause</em> or <em>forbearance</em>, where your obligation remains but you may not have to pay for a period.</p>
          <div class="info-box">
            <h3>Main Forgiveness/Discharge Pathways</h3>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF):</strong> 120 qualifying payments while working full-time at government or 501(c)(3) nonprofits.</li>
              <li><strong>Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) Forgiveness:</strong> Remaining balance canceled after 20–25 years on qualifying IDR plans.</li>
              <li><strong>Teacher Loan Forgiveness:</strong> Up to a set dollar amount for eligible teachers in qualifying schools.</li>
              <li><strong>Borrower Defense to Repayment:</strong> Relief if your school misled you or engaged in certain misconduct.</li>
              <li><strong>Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) Discharge:</strong> Cancellation if you meet disability criteria.</li>
              <li><strong>Closed School Discharge:</strong> If your school closed while you were enrolled or shortly after withdrawal.</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="trump-2017-2021">
          <h2>Trump Years (2017–2021): What Actually Happened</h2>
          <h3>1) COVID-19 Payment Pause and 0% Interest</h3>
          <p>Beginning March 2020, federal student loan payments were paused and interest was set to 0%. Initially authorized by Congress via the CARES Act and then extended by executive action, this measure provided substantial short-term relief. Importantly, it <em>did not</em> cancel balances—so it wasn’t forgiveness.</p>

          <h3>2) Proposals Affecting PSLF and IDR (Not Enacted by Congress)</h3>
          <p>Budget proposals and policy outlines discussed limiting or eliminating PSLF for future borrowers, consolidating IDR options into a single plan with different terms, and other structural changes. These were <strong>proposals</strong>, not laws—Congress did not enact broad cancellations during this period.</p>

          <h3>3) Borrower Defense Rules Tightened</h3>
          <p>Regulatory changes under the Department of Education narrowed criteria and emphasized partial relief in borrower defense cases compared to prior rules. Litigation and later administrations altered this area again, but during 2017–2021 standards were generally stricter.</p>

          <h3>4) Administrative Improvements Signed Into Law</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>FUTURE Act (2019):</strong> Improved IRS–Education data sharing to streamline IDR recertification.</li>
            <li><strong>Temporary Expanded PSLF (TEPSLF):</strong> A congressional fix intended to help borrowers who made payments under ineligible plans; implementation drew criticism for complexity.</li>
          </ul>

          <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Bottom line for 2017–2021:</strong> No broad, one-time cancellation was implemented. Relief centered on the pandemic-era pause and existing targeted programs under tighter standards.</p>
          </div>
        </section>

        <section id="outlook">
          <h2>Policy Outlook Under a Trump Agenda</h2>
          <p>Based on public statements and platform themes associated with Republican approaches through late 2024, you can generally expect:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Less emphasis on blanket forgiveness:</strong> Skepticism toward large, universal cancellation framed as unfair or beyond executive authority.</li>
            <li><strong>Institutional accountability:</strong> Greater focus on school outcomes, program ROI, and possible risk-sharing where colleges absorb part of default risk.</li>
            <li><strong>Lending guardrails:</strong> Potential scrutiny of Graduate and PLUS lending; proposals in the past have explored tighter limits.</li>
            <li><strong>Repayment plan recalibration:</strong> Consolidating IDR options, adjusting terms for sustainability, and aiming to reduce perceived moral hazard.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Any major changes would require either congressional legislation or formal rulemaking—and could face court challenges. Always check official sources for current status.</p>

              <h3>Did Donald Trump enact student loan forgiveness?</h3>
              <p>No broad, one-time cancellation was enacted during 2017–2021. The major relief was the COVID-19 payment pause and 0% interest, which was not forgiveness because balances were not canceled.</p>

              <h3>Is PSLF safe?</h3>

            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Will there be blanket forgiveness in the future?</h3>
              <p>Large-scale blanket cancellation is generally less likely under a Republican agenda. Real outcomes depend on Congress, agencies, and court rulings.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>What about borrower defense?</h3>
              <p>Rules tightened in 2017–2021 compared with prior policy. Standards and outcomes have changed across administrations and court decisions. If you have strong evidence, apply and keep copies of everything.</p>

            <div class="faq-item">
              <h3>Are IDR discharges taxable?</h3>
