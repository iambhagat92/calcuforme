4. Name it: `Calculate For Me Newsletter`
5. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)

### Step 2: Update Your Newsletter
1. Open `newsletter.html` 
2. Find line 423: `const FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT = 'https://formspree.io/f/xqakdbzy';`
3. Replace `xqakdbzy` with **your actual form ID**
4. Save the file

### Step 3: Test It!
1. Go to your newsletter page
