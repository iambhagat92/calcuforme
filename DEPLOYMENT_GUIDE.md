## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- All project files in the `F:\Calculate For Me` directory
- A GitHub account (for GitHub Pages and integration with Netlify/Vercel)
- Git installed on your computer
- Basic knowledge of command line operations

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages is free and perfect for static websites like Calculate For Me.

### Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository"
3. Name your repository (e.g., `Calculate For Me`)
4. Make it public (required for free GitHub Pages)
5. Don't initialize with README, .gitignore, or license
6. Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Initialize Local Repository

Open PowerShell in your project directory and run:

```powershell
cd F:\Calculate For Me
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Calculate For Me calculator suite"
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your GitHub username:

```powershell
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Calculate For Me.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 4: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click "Settings" â†’ "Pages" (in the sidebar)
3. Under "Source", select "main" branch
4. Click "Save"
5. Your site will be published at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/Calculate For Me/`

### Step 5: Update Links (Important!)

If your site is in a subdirectory (like `/Calculate For Me/`), update all links in your HTML files:

- Change `href="../css/style.css"` to `href="./css/style.css"`
- Change `href="../index.html"` to `href="./index.html"`
- Or use absolute URLs: `href="/Calculate For Me/css/style.css"`

**Note**: You may want to keep the current relative paths and deploy to a custom domain instead.

## Deploying to Netlify

Netlify offers continuous deployment, custom domains, and automatic HTTPS.

### Method 1: Drag and Drop (Easiest)

1. Go to [Netlify.com](https://www.netlify.com) and sign up/sign in
2. Click "Add new site" â†’ "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop your entire `F:\Calculate For Me` folder
4. Your site will be live at a random Netlify URL (e.g., `random-name-123.netlify.app`)
5. You can change the site name in Site settings

### Method 2: Connect to GitHub (Recommended)

1. First, push your code to GitHub (see steps above)
2. Go to Netlify and click "Add new site" â†’ "Import an existing project"
3. Connect to GitHub and select your repository
4. Configure build settings:
   - **Build command**: Leave empty (no build needed)
   - **Publish directory**: `/` (root directory)
5. Click "Deploy site"
6. Netlify will automatically redeploy when you push changes to GitHub

### Custom Domain on Netlify

1. Go to Site settings â†’ Domain management
2. Click "Add custom domain"
3. Follow instructions to:
   - Purchase a domain through Netlify, or
   - Connect your existing domain by updating DNS records

## Deploying to Vercel

Vercel is optimized for frontend projects with excellent performance.

### Step 1: Install Vercel CLI

```powershell
npm install -g vercel
```

If you don't have Node.js/npm installed:
1. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
2. Install and restart PowerShell
3. Run the command above

### Step 2: Deploy

```powershell
cd F:\Calculate For Me
vercel
```

Follow the prompts:
- Set up and deploy? **Y**
- Which scope? Select your account
- Link to existing project? **N**
- Project name? `Calculate For Me` (or your preferred name)
- In which directory is your code located? `./ ` (current directory)

Your site will be deployed and you'll receive a URL like `Calculate For Me.vercel.app`

### Method 2: Deploy via GitHub

1. Push your code to GitHub (see steps above)
2. Go to [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign in with GitHub
3. Click "Add New" â†’ "Project"
4. Import your GitHub repository
5. Configure:
   - **Framework Preset**: Other
   - **Build Command**: Leave empty
   - **Output Directory**: Leave empty
6. Click "Deploy"

## Custom Domain Setup

### For GitHub Pages

1. Purchase a domain from a registrar (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In your DNS settings, add these records:
   ```
   Type  | Host | Value
   ------|------|------
   A     | @    | 185.199.108.153
   A     | @    | 185.199.109.153
   A     | @    | 185.199.110.153
   A     | @    | 185.199.111.153
   CNAME | www  | YOUR_USERNAME.github.io
   ```
3. In your repo, go to Settings â†’ Pages
4. Enter your custom domain and save
5. Enable "Enforce HTTPS"

### For Netlify/Vercel

1. Go to domain settings in the platform
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update your domain's DNS records as instructed
4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)
5. HTTPS is automatically configured

## SEO Optimization

### Completed âœ“
- Meta descriptions added to all calculator pages
- Semantic HTML structure
- Descriptive titles

### To Add

#### Create `robots.txt` in root directory:
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /

Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
```

#### Create `sitemap.xml` in root directory:
```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9">
  <url>
    <loc>https://yourdomain.com/</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-01-03</lastmod>
    <priority>1.0</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://yourdomain.com/calculators/bmi-calculator.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-01-03</lastmod>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <url>
    <loc>https://yourdomain.com/calculators/age-calculator.html</loc>
    <lastmod>2025-01-03</lastmod>
    <priority>0.8</priority>
  </url>
  <!-- Add all calculator pages -->
</urlset>
```

#### Add Google Analytics

1. Create a Google Analytics account at [analytics.google.com](https://analytics.google.com)
2. Get your Measurement ID (format: G-XXXXXXXXXX)
3. Add this code to the `<head>` section of all HTML files:

```html
<!-- Google Analytics -->
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script>
  window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
  function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
  gtag('js', new Date());
  gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
</script>
```

## Performance Optimization

### Images
- Use WebP format for images
- Compress images with tools like TinyPNG
- Add `loading="lazy"` to images

### CSS/JS
- Minify CSS and JavaScript
- Use a CDN for Font Awesome (already implemented)
- Enable browser caching

### Hosting Settings

**Netlify:**
- Automatically minifies assets
- Provides global CDN
- Enable "Asset Optimization" in Build settings

**Vercel:**
- Automatic CDN
- Edge caching enabled by default
- Excellent performance out of the box

## Testing After Deployment

After deploying, test:
1. âœ“ All calculator links work
2. âœ“ Forms submit properly
3. âœ“ Mobile responsiveness
4. âœ“ All pages load correctly
5. âœ“ Navigation works
6. âœ“ CSS and JavaScript load properly

## Continuous Updates

### Via GitHub
1. Make changes locally
2. Commit and push:
   ```powershell
   git add .
   git commit -m "Description of changes"
   git push
   ```
3. If connected to Netlify/Vercel, changes deploy automatically
4. For GitHub Pages, changes may take a few minutes to appear

## Troubleshooting

### Links not working
- Check if paths are correct (relative vs absolute)
- Ensure file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### CSS/JS not loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify file paths in HTML
- Clear browser cache

### GitHub Pages 404 error
- Ensure repository is public
- Check that GitHub Pages is enabled
- Wait a few minutes for initial deployment

### Custom domain not working
- Verify DNS records are correct
- Wait for DNS propagation (up to 48 hours)
- Check that HTTPS enforcement isn't causing issues
